The factors we consider while optimizing the solutions for this problem is very generic andapplies to most data-intensive applications. So if you whatever you would be learning in this chapter, you should be able toapply that knowledge for most design problems.
Algorithm design, Low Level Design, doing great at technical interviews are all learnable skills. Once you get a hang of it, you would not only crack just one interview, but several ones. My mission is to help you get as much close to that state as possible.So please make sure you learn the thought process involved here: how we optimize solutions and do trade-offs, so that youcan recreate your success in as many interviews you want. So, buckle up and enjoy! Happy learning!
